##               SERVICE STATEMENT            ##        
================================================ 

If you are using the code written for a larger project, we are 
happy to consult with you and help you with deployment. Our team 
has >10 world experts in Kafka distributed architectures, microservices 
built on top of Node.js / Python / Docker, and applying machine learning to 
model speech and text data. 

We have helped a wide variety of enterprises - small businesses, 
researchers, enterprises, and/or independent developers. 

If you would like to work with us let us know @ js@neurolex.co.

##              SELECT_FEATURES.PY            ##    
================================================ 

Select the most relevant features.

Examples include:

(1) Filter method - Chi squared
(2) Wrapper method - Recursive feature elimination
(3) Embedded method - LASSO

##                  Chi Square test                    ##
#########################################################
'''
This score can be used to select the n_features features with the 
highest values for the test chi-squared statistic from X, which must 
contain only non-negative features such as booleans or frequencies 
(e.g., term counts in document classification), relative to the classes.

Recall that the chi-square test measures dependence between stochastic variables, 
so using this function “weeds out” the features that are the most 
likely to be independent of class and therefore irrelevant for classification.

##           Recursive feature elimination             ##
#########################################################
'''
Recursive feature elmination works by recursively removing 
attributes and building a model on attributes that remain. 
It uses model accuracy to identify which attributes
(and combinations of attributes) contribute the most to predicting the
target attribute. You can learn more about the RFE class in
the scikit-learn documentation.
